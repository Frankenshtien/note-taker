# Note Taker

## Description:

This was a project to demonstrate creating a backend for an existing frontend, and deploying it to a live server. It is an application designed to be able to create new notes with a title, text, and unique ID, and save them to a database (JSON file) to be reviewed later. It used Node.js, and Express.js as the backend, UUID NPM package to create unique ID's, and Heroku to host the application.
